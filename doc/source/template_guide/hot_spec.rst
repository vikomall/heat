===============================================
Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) Specification
===============================================

HOT is a new template format meant to replace the Heat CloudFormation-compatible
format (CFN) as the native format supported by the Heat over time.
This specification explains in detail all elements of the HOT template format.
An example driven guide to writing HOT templates can be found
at :ref:`hot_guide`.

------
Status
------

HOT support is still under development and needs more work to provide access to
all functionality currently available via the CFN compatible template interface.
This specification will be updated periodically whenever new features get
implemented for HOT.

------------------
Template Structure
------------------

HOT templates are defined in YAML and follow the structure outlined below.

::

  heat_template_version: 2013-05-23

  description: 
    # a description of the template

  parameter_groups:
    # a declaration of input parameter groups and order

  parameters:
    # declaration of input parameters

  resources:
    # declaration of template resources

  outputs:
    # declaration of output parameters

heat_template_version
    This key with value *2013-05-23* (or a later date) indicates that the YAML
    document is a HOT template of the specified version.

description
    This *optional* key allows for giving a description of the template, or the
    workload that can be deployed using the template.

parameter_groups
    This section allows for specifying how the input parameters should be
    grouped and the order to provide the parameters in. This section is
    *optional* and can be omitted when necessary.

parameters
    This section allows for specifying input parameters that have to be provided
    when instantiating the template. The section is *optional* and can be
    omitted when no input is required.

resources
    This section contains the declaration of the single resources of the
    template. This section is mandatory and at least one resource must be
    defined in any HOT template.

outputs
    This section allows for specifying output parameters available to users once
    the template has been instantiated. This section is *optional* and can be
    omitted when no output values are required.


.. _hot_spec_parameter_groups:

------------------------
Parameter Groups Section
------------------------

The *parameter_groups* section allows for specifying how the input parameters
should be grouped and the order to provide the parameters in. These groups are
typically used to describe expected behavior for downstream user interfaces.

These groups are specified in a list with each group containing a list of
associated parameters. The lists are used to denote the expected order of the
parameters. Each parameter should be associated to a specific group only once
using the parameter name to bind it to a defined parameter in the parameters
section.

::

  parameter_groups:
  - label: <human-readable label of parameter group>
    description: <description of the parameter group>
    parameters:
    - <param name>
    - <param name>

label
    A human-readable label that defines the associated group of parameters.

description
    This attribute allows for giving a human-readable description of the
    parameter group.

parameters
    A list of parameters associated with this parameter group.

param name
    The name of the parameter that is defined in the associated parameters
    section.


.. _hot_spec_parameters:

------------------
Parameters Section
------------------

The *parameters* section allows for specifying input parameters that have to be
provided when instantiating the template. Such parameters are typically used to
customize each deployment (e.g. by setting custom user names or passwords) or
for binding to environment-specifics like certain images.

Each parameter is specified in a separated nested block with the name of the
parameters defined in the first line and additional attributes such as type or
default value defined as nested elements.

::

  parameters:
    <param name>:
      type: <string | number | json | comma_delimited_list>
      description: <description of the parameter>
      default: <default value for parameter>
      hidden: <true | false>
      constraints:
        <parameter constraints>

param name
    The name of the parameter is defined at the top of each parameter block.

type
    This attribute specifies the type of parameter. Currently supported types
    are *string*, *number*, *comma_delimited_list* or *json*.

description
    This *optional* attribute allows for giving a human readable description of
    the parameter.

default
    This *optional* attribute allows for defining a default value for the
    parameters which will be used in case the parameter is not specified by the
    user during deployment.

hidden
    This *optional* attribute allows for specifying whether the parameters
    should be hidden when showing information about a stack created from the
    template at runtime (e.g. for hiding passwords that were specified as
    parameters). If not specified, the default value 'false' will be used.

constraints
    This *optional* block allows for specifying additional constraints on the
    parameter, such as minimum or maximum values for numeric parameters.

The following example shows a minimalistic definition of two parameters. Note
that the description is actually optional, but is good practice to provide a
useful description for each parameter.

::

  parameters:
    user_name:
      type: string
      description: User name to be configured for the application
    port_number:
      type: number
      description: Port number to be configured for the web server


.. _hot_spec_parameters_constraints:

Parameter Constraints
---------------------

The *constraints* block of a parameter definition allows for defining additional
validation constraints that apply to the value of the parameter. At
instantiation time of the template, user provided parameter values are validated
against those constraints to make sure the provided values match expectations of
the template author.
Constraints are defined in the form of a bulleted list according to the
following syntax:

::

  constraints:
    - <constraint type>: <constraint definition>
      description: <constraint description>

constraint type
    The constraint type specifies the kind of constraint defined in the current
    bulleted list item. The set of currently supported constraints is given
    below.

constraint definition
    This value defines the actual constraint, depending on the constraint type.
    The concrete syntax for each constraint type is given below.

description
    This *optional* attribute allows for specifying a concrete description of
    the current constraint. This text will be presented to the user, for
    example, when the provided input value for a parameter violates the
    constraint. If omitted, a default validation message will be presented to
    the user.

The following example show the definition of a string parameter with two
constraints. Note that while the descriptions for each constraint are optional,
it is good practice to provide concrete descriptions so useful messages can be
presented to the user at deployment time.

::

  parameters:
    user_name:
      type: string
      description: User name to be configured for the application
      constraints:
        - length: { min: 6, max: 8 }
          description: User name must be between 6 and 8 characters
        - allowed_pattern: "[A-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9]*"
          description: User name must start with an uppercase character

The following sections list the supported types of parameter constraints, along
with the concrete syntax for each type.

length
~~~~~~
The *length* constraint applies to parameters of type *string* and allows for
defining a lower and upper limit for the length of the string value. The syntax
for the length constraint is:

::

  length: { min: <lower limit>, max: <upper limit> }

It is possible to define a length constraint with only a lower limit or an
upper limit. However, at least one of *min* or *max* must be specified.

range
~~~~~
The *range* constraint applies to parameters of type *number* and allows for
defining a lower and upper limit for the numeric value of the parameter. The
syntax of the range constraint is:

::

  range: { min: <lower limit>, max: <upper limit> }

It is possible to define a range constraint with only a lower limit or an
upper limit. However, at least one of *min* or *max* must be specified.
The minimum or maximum boundaries are included in the range. For example, the
following range constraint would allow for all numeric values between 0 and 10.

::

  range: { min: 0, max: 10 }


allowed_values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *allowed_values* constraint applies to parameters of type string or number
and allows for specifying a set of possible values for a parameter. At
deployment time, the user provided value for the respective parameter must
match one of the elements of the specified list. The syntax of the
allowed_values constraint is:

::

  allowed_values: [ <value>, <value>, ... ]

Alternatively, the YAML bulleted list notation can be used:

::

  allowed_values:
    - <value>
    - <value>
    - ...

For example:

::

  parameters:
    instance_type:
      type: string
      description: Instance type for compute instances
      constraints:
        allowed_values:
          - m1.small
          - m1.medium
          - m1.large

allowed_pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *allowed_pattern* constraint applies to parameters of type string and allows
for specifying a regular expression against which a user provided parameter
value must evaluate at deployment
The syntax of the allowed_pattern constraint is:

::

  allowed_pattern: <regular expression>

For example:

::

  parameters:
    user_name:
      type: string
      description: User name to be configured for the application
      constraints:
        - allowed_pattern: "[A-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9]*"
          description: User name must start with an uppercase character


.. _hot_spec_resources:

-----------------
Resources Section
-----------------

In the *resources* section, the templates for actual resources that will make up
a stack deployed from the HOT template (e.g. compute instances, networks,
storage volumes) are defined.
Each resource is defined as a separate block in the resources section according
to the syntax below.

::

  resources:
    <resource ID>:
      type: <resource type>
      properties:
        <property name>: <property value>
      # more resource specific metadata

resource ID
    A resource block is headed by the resource ID, which must be unique within
    the resource section of a template.
type
    This attribute specifies the type of resource, such as OS::Nova::Server.
properties
    This section contains a list of resource specific properties. The property
    value can be provided in place, or can be provided via a function
    (see :ref:`hot_spec_intrinsic_functions`).

Depending on the type of resource, the resource block might include more
resource specific metadata. Basically all resource types that can be used in
CFN templates can also be used in HOT templates, adapted to the YAML structure
as outlined above.
Below is an example of a simple compute resource definition with some fixed
property values.

::

  resources:
    my_instance:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        flavor: m1.small
        image: F18-x86_64-cfntools


.. _hot_spec_outputs:

---------------
Outputs Section
---------------

In the *outputs* section, any output parameters that should be available to the
user can be defined. Typically, this would be, for example, parameters such as
IP addresses of deployed instances, or URLs of web applications deployed as part
of a stack.

Each output parameter is defined as a separate block within the outputs section
according to the following syntax:

::

  outputs:
    <parameter name>:
      description: <description>
      value: <parameter value>

parameter name
    An output parameter block is headed by the output parameter name, which must
    be unique within the outputs section of a template.
description
    This element gives a short description of the output parameter.
parameter value
    This element specifies the value of the output parameter. Typically, this
    will be resolved by means of a function, e.g. by getting an attribute value
    of one of the stack's resources (see also
    :ref:`hot_spec_intrinsic_functions`).

The example below shows, how the IP address of a compute resource can be defined
as an output parameter.

::

  outputs:
    instance_ip:
      description: IP address of the deployed compute instance
      value: { get_attr: [my_instance, first_address] }


.. _hot_spec_intrinsic_functions:

-------------------
Intrinsic Functions
-------------------
HOT provides a set of intrinsic functions that can be used inside HOT templates
to perform specific tasks, such as getting the value of a resource attribute at
runtime. A definition of all intrinsic functions available in HOT is given
below.

get_param
---------
The *get_param* function allows for referencing an input parameter of a template
from anywhere within a template. At runtime, it will be resolved to the value
provided for this input parameter. The syntax of the get_param function is as
follows:

::

  get_param: <parameter name>

The *parameter name* of the input parameter to be resolved is given as single
parameter to this function. A sample use of this function in context of a
resource definition is shown below.

::

  parameters:
    instance_type:
      type: string
      description: Instance type to be used.

  resources:
    my_instance:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        flavor: { get_param: instance_type}


get_attr
--------
The *get_attr* function allows for referencing an attribute of a resource. At
runtime, it will be resolved to the value of an attribute of a resource instance
created from the respective resource definition of the template.
The syntax of the get_attr function is as follows:

::

  get_attr: [ <resource ID>, <attribute name> ]

resource ID
    This parameter specifies the resource the attribute of which shall be
    resolved. This resource must be defined within the *resources* section of
    the template (see also :ref:`hot_spec_resources`).
attribute name
    This parameter specifies the attribute to be resolved.

An example of using the get_attr function is shown below:

::

  resources:
    my_instance:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      # ...

  outputs:
    instance_ip:
      description: IP address of the deployed compute instance
      value: { get_attr: [my_instance, first_address] }


get_resource
------------
The *get_resource* function allows for referencing another resource within the
same template. At runtime, it will be resolved to reference ID of the resource,
which is resource type specific. For example, a reference to a floating IP
resource will return the respective IP address at runtime.
The syntax of the get_resource function is as follows:

::

  get_resource: <resource ID>

The *resource ID* of the referenced resources as used in the current template is
given as single parameter to the get_resource function.


str_replace
-----------
The *str_replace* function allows for dynamically constructing strings by
providing a template string with placeholders and a list of mappings to assign
values to those placeholders at runtime. The placeholders are replaced with
mapping values wherever a mapping key exactly matches a placeholder.
The syntax of the str_replace function is as follows:

::

  str_replace:
    template: <template string>
    params: <parameter mappings>

template
    The *template* argument defines the template string that contains
    placeholders which will be substituted at runtime.
params
    The *params* argument provides parameter mappings in the form of a
    dictionary, which will be used for placeholder substitution in the template
    string at runtime. Within parameter mappings one can make use of other
    functions (e.g. get_attr to use resource attribute values) for template
    substitution.

The example below shows a simple use of the str_replace function in the outputs
section of a template to build a URL for logging into a deployed application.

::

  resources:
    my_instance:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      # general metadata and properties ...

  outputs:
    Login_URL:
      description: The URL to log into the deployed application
      value:
        str_replace:
          template: http://host/MyApplication
          params:
            host: { get_attr: [ my_instance, first_address ] }

The str_replace function can also be used for constructing bigger chunks of text
like scripts for initializing compute instances as shown in the example below:

::

  parameters:
    DBRootPassword:
      type: string
      description: Root password for MySQL
      hidden: true

  resources:
    my_instance:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        # general properties ...
        user_data:
          str_replace:
            template: |
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Hello world"
              echo "Setting MySQL root password"
              mysqladmin -u root password $db_rootpassword
              # do more things ...
            params:
              $db_rootpassword: { get_param: DBRootPassword }

In the example above, one can imagine that MySQL is being configured on a
compute instance and the root password is going to be set based on a user
provided parameter. The script for doing this is provided as userdata to the
compute instance, leveraging the str_replace function.
